# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

This project aims to enhance customer segmentation for online sales by leveraging machine learning techniques. It focuses on clustering customers based on their demographics, purchase behaviors, and preferences to support targeted marketing strategies.

## OVERVIEW
Effective customer segmentation is essential for personalized marketing, yet traditional methods often fall short in addressing modern, data-rich environments. This project applies K-Means and Mean-Shift clustering on online sales data to identify distinct customer segments, helping businesses fine-tune their marketing efforts. Key insights from the project show that K-Means outperforms in creating well-defined clusters, making it an optimal choice for actionable customer groups.

## FEATURES
- Utilizes K-Means and Mean-Shift clustering to classify customers into distinct segments.
- Implements data preprocessing and feature selection to enhance clustering accuracy.
- Includes evaluation metrics to compare the effectiveness of clustering algorithms.
- Provides insights on segment characteristics for practical marketing applications.
- Suggests future improvements, such as incorporating behavioral data and advanced visualization techniques.

## USAGE
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset as outlined in the `data_preprocessing.py` script.
3. Run the clustering algorithms using `clustering_model.py` to generate customer segments.
4. Visualize and analyze the results using the included visualization tools and example notebooks.
