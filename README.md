This project applies machine learning techniques to segment customers based on online sales data, aiming to improve targeted marketing strategies. Using K-Means and Mean-Shift clustering algorithms, it organizes customers by key factors like demographics, purchase behaviors, and product preferences. The project workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction to optimize clustering performance. A comparison of K-Means and Mean-Shift highlights clustering effectiveness, with K-Means demonstrating better-defined customer groups. The findings provide actionable insights for businesses seeking to personalize marketing efforts, and the project suggests future enhancements such as integrating behavioral data and advanced visualizations to refine segmentation further.
